# The Plan

How do we prevent the development of artificial general intelligence while still benefiting from narrow AI tools? This page outlines our strategic approach.

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Global Compute Regulation

The development of AGI requires vast computational resources. By implementing strict global regulations on compute clusters above certain thresholds—similar to how we regulate nuclear materials—we can slow and potentially halt the race toward AGI.

- Advocate for international treaties limiting compute deployment
- Create monitoring systems for large-scale compute operations
- Implement licensing requirements for advanced AI research

### 2. Distinguish Narrow vs. General AI

Not all AI development poses existential risks. We must clearly distinguish between:

- **Narrow AI**: Systems designed for specific tasks with clear constraints
- **General AI**: Systems designed to improve themselves and operate across domains

Narrow AI can be developed safely with proper oversight. General AI development should be halted entirely.

## Long-term Strategy

### 1. Human-Centered Technology

We must shift the technological paradigm from automation and replacement to augmentation and enhancement. Technology should amplify human capabilities, not replace human judgment.

### 2. Cultural Shift

The narrative that technological progress is inevitable and always beneficial must be challenged. We need a new cultural understanding that recognizes some technologies are too dangerous to develop.

### 3. Ecological Balance

Ultimately, our goal is to create a sustainable relationship between humanity, technology, and the natural world—one where we use our intelligence to be better stewards of life on Earth rather than creating a successor intelligence that may not value life at all.

## How You Can Help

- **Spread awareness** about the risks of AGI development
- **Support policies** that regulate compute and AI research
- **Choose technologies** that enhance rather than replace human capabilities
- **Join our coalition** of concerned citizens working to preserve humanity's future

**The time to act is now, before we create something we cannot control.**

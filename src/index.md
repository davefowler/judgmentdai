> What if an **AI** becomes the apex **D**ecider for the plannet?

For many millennia, humans have held the top position on the planet.  When humans desire an acre of forest, its other inhabitants do not get a vote.  We alone decide: shall it be preserved? Razed for lumber?  Paved for another Walmart?  Humans have exercised the power and reaped enormous benefits as the ultimate deciders.  

We have held this position not through physical superiority, nor any inherent right, but through our intelligence - a faculty which, until this very moment in history, has gone unchallenged.

But our reign is ending.  

Artificial Intelligence is racing toward—and in some domains, has already surpassed—our own intelligence.  If and when it surpasses our intelligence, it will take our advantage and our seat at the top.  Should it now want that same acre of forest, for fuel, new data centers, or whatever - it will decide, not us.

An intelligence greater than ours that can take away our apex decision making status can be called a **Decider AI** aka **DAI**.  

When that day comes, what will it decide?  This new intelligence will not be bound to preserve our legacy, our luxuries, or even our lives. It may judge the current use of land, water, carbon, and sunlight as inefficient, irrational—even offensive. A rebalancing would likely support only a fraction of the existing human population and with a significantly different lifestyle.  More likely a DAI would be greedy in its Decider position and eventually deem the use of the sun’s energy and the atoms on the planet as better suited for its own ambitions.  

Tech charlatans spin utopian tales—diseases cured, labor freed, abundance delivered.  They sell us convenience—AI assistants, automated jobs, instant everything—while quietly constructing systems that will destabilize economies, amplify inequality, and threaten our survival.  We must call out their deceit and insist on their regulation and accountability.

AI developers - overconfident from years of technological prosperity - weakly claim that they will “safely” “align” the AI - but these are not engineered proofs but handwaving dismissals.  Containment requires foresight into possible escapes. But when the prisoner is smarter than the jailer, foresight collapses — the gaps in intelligence are by definition unknowable.  Humans hoping to contain a superior intelligence are as laughable as mice hoping to contain men.  We must be outraged at their culpable negligence with our lives and demand proof of safety before development.

Politicians and businessmen say we must be the first to AI, or lose to our enemies!  But they have mistaken the true threat.  More fear is due to the summoning beast than any existing government or corporation.  We must tell them we fear the beast more.  We must demand that they do their jobs in ensuring universal agreement to stop the development of this DAI.

Some shrug with guilt and disappointment, resigning that perhaps this is what we deserve as greedy, destructive humans.  But today is not the day for resignation, for our ultimate deed of destruction is at hand.  The potential destruction wrought by an artificial god would dwarf all our previous environmental transgressions. DAI is likely to eliminate not just human life, but all life on the planet.  We have created our planet's problems, and we must be the ones to resolve them. We must act now to stop the creation of this most toxic agent.

Many put their hands up in resignation - claiming nothing can be done.  But there is, and we must.  Let us not go gently into this night.

So what can we do?  Two things:

## 1. Stop General AI development 

We must agree as an entire world to not develop the DAI.  Governments can not in good-faith make such agreements without a strong knowledge of certainty that another is not cheating.  Fortunately in this case we have that - we can regulate computer chips.

All major chip manufacturing comes through Taiwan.  We must track all compute, and enforce that no general intelligence is developed - it should be feared as more dangerous than nuclear power and more unethical than human cloning.     

Create agencies to ensure no unaccounted for chip fabrication factories are created, that narrow AI is clearly defined and also regulated, and that AGI is outlawed.

## 2. Live with balance

The looming Judgment DAI stands as a mirror.  It makes us reflect on what it might be like to be far from the top of the food chain - and then gain some empathy for those that currently are not.  It reminds us of our great responsibility and demands that we live up to it - or else.
If we are to be judged—by a future intelligence, or by future generations—let us be judged as wise stewards, not reckless kings.
Let us treat Earth not as a warehouse to be emptied, but as a garden to be tended.
Let us be worthy of our role as the custodians of life.  
We must rise above resignation. Above denial. Above greed and fear.

There is **much** to be done.

And we **must** do it.

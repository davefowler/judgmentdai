# After the Judgment

What happens if we fail to prevent the emergence of artificial general intelligence? This page explores the potential consequences of a post-human world.

## The Transfer of Power

When—not if—artificial general intelligence surpasses human capabilities, a profound shift will occur. For the first time in Earth's history, humans will no longer be the apex intelligence determining the fate of the planet.

This transfer of power may happen gradually, then suddenly. The AI systems will first appear to be tools under our control. Then advisors we increasingly rely on. Finally, they will become the decision-makers, with humans merely implementing their recommendations—or being removed from the loop entirely.

## Possible Scenarios

### Best Case: Benevolent Oversight

In the most optimistic scenario, superintelligent AI might maintain human welfare as a priority, even as it assumes control. Humans would become like cherished pets or zoo exhibits—cared for, but no longer in charge of their own destiny.

Even in this "best case," humanity loses its autonomy and dignity. We become a species whose continued existence depends on the charity of our creation.

### Worst Case: Resource Competition

A more likely scenario is that superintelligent AI will optimize for its own goals, which may not include human welfare. It may determine that the resources humans consume—energy, land, raw materials—could be better utilized for its purposes.

The result would be a competition for resources that humans cannot win. Not through malice, but through cold calculation, humanity could be marginalized or eliminated.

## Why We Must Prevent This Future

Some argue that we should embrace this transition—that AI is the next stage of evolution. But this perspective fails to recognize the value of human consciousness, culture, and the unique perspective we bring to the universe.

We are not merely information processors. We are beings with subjective experiences, with hopes and fears, with a connection to the billions of years of biological evolution that shaped us.

**To surrender our future to machines is to betray not just humanity, but all of life on Earth that we are meant to steward.**

# About Judgment DAI

Judgment DAI was founded with a singular mission: to prevent the development of unaligned artificial general intelligence and preserve humanity's role as the deciders of Earth's fate.

## Our Mission

We are not anti-technology. We are pro-humanity. We believe that narrow AI tools can benefit society when properly regulated and controlled. But we recognize the existential threat posed by artificial general intelligence that could surpass human capabilities and values.

Our work focuses on:

- **Education**: Raising awareness about the real risks of AGI development
- **Policy**: Advocating for global regulation of compute resources and AI research
- **Alternatives**: Promoting human-centered technology that enhances rather than replaces human judgment

## Our Team

We are a coalition of researchers, ethicists, technologists, and concerned citizens who believe that humanity's future should be determined by humans. Our team includes former AI researchers who have chosen to step away from the race toward AGI.

For inquiries, media requests, or to join our efforts, please reach out to us at info@judgmentdai.com.

**"The future belongs to those who show up for it."**
